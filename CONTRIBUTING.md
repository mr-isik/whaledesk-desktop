## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.25+**
- **Node.js 18+** & npm
- **Wails CLI**: `go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest`
- **Docker Engine** or Docker Desktop (required for Docker features)
- **PostgreSQL server** (optional, for DB Manager testing)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install --prefix frontend
```

### Run in Development

```bash
wails dev
```

> _This starts Vite and the Wails dev server. Use `http://localhost:34115` to access the devtools bridge._

---

## 📁 Project Layout

- `main.go` - App entrypoint
- `bindings/` - Wails bindings used by the frontend
- `internal/` - Domain, ports, usecases, and infrastructure adapters
- `frontend/` - React UI built with Vite
- `frontend/wailsjs/` - Auto-generated bindings (**do not edit manually**)

---

## 📏 Coding Guidelines

### Go

- Use `gofmt` on all Go files before committing.
- Keep usecase logic isolated in `internal/usecase/`.
- Keep external integrations (DB, Docker, etc.) in `internal/infrastructure/`.
- Keep interfaces well-defined in `internal/ports/`.

### Frontend

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code.
- Follow existing UI styles (glass-card, badges, buttons).
- Keep pages organized in `frontend/src/pages/`.
- Keep layout and navigation components in `frontend/src/layouts/`.
- Avoid inline refactors that are unrelated to your current change.

---

## ✅ Running Checks

There is no formal test suite yet, but please ensure your code is clean before submitting:

```bash
# Format Go code
gofmt -w ./...

# Build frontend to check for TS/Lint errors
npm run build --prefix frontend
```

If possible on your platform, also verify the complete Wails build:

```bash
wails build
```

3. Update **docs and screenshots** if your change affects the UI.
4. Ensure all checks in the "Running Checks" section pass.
5. Open a **PR** with a clear summary, and include any relevant logs or screenshots.
